### Examples

## Algorithms

Using [SHA256](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2) for creating password hash used.  
Using [AES (advanced encryption standard)](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard) for encrypting and decrypting file contents. For example [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/) uses [AES algorithm](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard) (optional) for encrypting [UAssets](https://docs.fileformat.com/game/uasset/) in built games.
